# SE461-TetrisProject
**Group Project: JUnit and Test Coverage Criteria**

To develop JUnit test cases to test a Tetris video game written in Java. The source code is included in the Tetris-Testing.zip file. Download the zip file, unzip it, and import the project into your Eclipse workspace.
There will be 12 groups in the class, and each group should have no more than 3 members.
Your team must use at least one of the test coverage criteria that we have learned in SE 461 to
develop JUnit test cases. This is similar to Question 1 of Assignment 3, except that we have a
code base (instead of a single method) consisting of five classes to test.

Use JaCoCo (https://www.jacoco.org/), a Java code coverage tool, to generate a code coverage
report, such as lines coverage, methods coverage, and branches coverage

Write a project report that covers the following aspects:
  1. **Test design**: use at least three examples to explain how your team developed JUnit test
  cases to satisfy the coverage criterion/criteria that your team used. The explanation
  should be specific and similar to your answers to Question 1 of Assignment 3 (e.g.,
  include graphs, TRs, test cases, and test paths). For each test case, explain what your
  input is and what your expected output is.
  2. **Test results and analysis**: what problem(s) did you find in the code? For each problem,
  further explain how you found it (e.g., using which test case). What is your JaCoCo code
  coverage score? How did your team improve your coverage score? Include screenshots
  of JaCoCo test reports.
  3. **Reflection and lessons learned**: describe your experience of designing JUnit test cases in this project and how your test coverage criteria helped (or hindered?) your test design. Putting everything together, what worked, what did not? What are your overall thoughts about software testing, test coverage criteria, or Junit?
  
Your project will be graded based on the following aspects.
  1. Code coverage score that JaCoCo reported.
  2. The number and quality of JUnit test cases that you have developed.
  3. The completeness and quality of your project report.
  4. The problems that you have found in the Tetris code.
  5. Project presentation as described below.

At the end, each team should submit two files to Cougar Course: (1) project report and (2) the zipped project file that includes your test cases for the Tetris application.
Additionally, each team will give an in-class presentation about their project. The presentation counts 20% towards your project grade
